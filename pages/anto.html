        <h2>victim</h2>
        <p>
          victim is the first artificial stick figure ever created by The Animator and the first stick figure in the
          franchise as a whole.Being the main protagonist of the original Animator vs. Animation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Animator created him with the intention of torturing him for fun. After being toyed with, victim became
          angry at his creator and began fighting for his survival, using many tools he found/made to retaliate against
          his abuser and even making clones of himself to help in overpowering the cursor. Despite nearly succeeding,
          the Animator ended the fight by simply closing the Flash window and choosing not to save, presumably ending
          victim's short existence after which he comes again after Approximately 17 years later to take revenge

        <h2>The Dark Lord</h2>
        <p>
          The Dark Lord (tentatively known as The Chosen One's enemy) is a red artificial stick figure that was created
          by Alan Becker for the sole purpose of destroying The Chosen One
        </p>
        <p>
          He was initially loyal to his creator and the mission imprinted onto him until The Chosen One bested him, but
          instead chose to display mercy to his enemy and revealed to him that Alan only saw him as a tool and cared for
          him no more than he did the black stick figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost seven years later, it was revealed in "The Flashback" that both The Dark Lord and The Chosen One were
          able to escape the computer by opening a doorway to the Internet just moments before the computer crashed.

        <h2>ViraBot</h2>
        <p>
          The ViraBot is a type of virus created by The Dark Lord that serves as the secondary antagonist of Season 2
          and a posthumous antagonist in the Actual Shorts miniseries, both as an individual agent and as a group. They
          were programmed by The Dark Lord in order to conquer the global network after being fueled by powerlust
          following his seven-year rampage across the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally, one was sent by The Dark Lord to infect and ultimately destroy ALANSPC as both a test run and as a
          means of revenge against his creator, but failed due to the intervention of The Chosen One, saving both Alan's
          computer and The Second Coming along with his friends.

        <h2>Agent</h2>
        <p>
          Agent is the leader of the mercenary group that works under victim and his organization in Animator vs.
          Animation Season 3, where he and his associates seek to claim a bounty placed on The Chosen One for his
          capture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agent has arm gadgets (unofficially named "Toolbars" or "Animator UI") on each of his arms, which give him
          access of tools identical to those used in Adobe Animate. He can designate one tool per arm and change which
          tool he can use at will

        <h2>ballista</h2>
        <p>
          Ballista is one of the four mercenaries that works for victim and his organization in Animator vs. Animation
          VI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ballista is a short, pixelated stick figure with a white solid head. He can shapeshift his body to various
          degrees (such as splitting his head in half to reveal a gun), and he also possesses gigantic teeth, making him
          the only stick figure capable of showing emotions through means other than body language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ballista can shapeshift his body to suit different situations and he is stronger than the average stick
          figure, able to send a barrage of punches to a shark The Second Coming created
        </p>

      <dialog id="primald">
        <h2>Primal</h2>
        <p>
          Primal is one of the four mercenaries that works for victim and his organization in Animator vs. Animation VI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Primal is a sentient caveman drawing and can shapeshift. His base form is a tall chocolate-brown stick figure
          with a solid head, broad shoulders and hips, and a narrow waist. His body is a bit thicker than that of most
          other stick figures. His surface is roughly granulated, resembling a pencil drawing. The edges of his body are
          fuzzy and flicker constantly. He has stubby feet and even blurry hands with fingers, which can be seen up
          close.
        </p>
        <p>
          He possesses a second stronger form where he becomes much more muscular, and swirling spirals appear above his
          back and shoulders. In this form he runs on all fours like a gorilla.
        </p>
      </dialog>
      <dialog id="hazardd">
        <h2>Hazard</h2>
        <p>
          Hazard is one of the four mercenaries that works for victim and his organization in Animator vs. Animation
          Season 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hazard is, as to be expected from such a description, a pictogram stick figure one would see on various signs.
          He is tall, with a dark grey body. His solid head is separate from the rest of his body, he has a light gray
          outline and, unlike the others, noticeably has an actual "body" of sorts and isn't just a flat line. For
          whatever reason, he has very limited movement and moves on a lower framerate. In certain postures, he is
          completely flat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hazard does not seem to have any powers, at least not at first glance, but he does have exceptional
          hand-to-hand combat skills that put The Second Coming on the defensive. He also has the ability to electrocute
          objects into dust and is seen to express through signs. He is also one of the few stickmen we have seen to
          make sounds, like a car alarm. As a side note, it could be argued that Hazard has abnormal speed due to his
          capability of seemingly darting from one pose to another. He also is animated in the lowest framerate because
          he can quickly dart from one position to another.
