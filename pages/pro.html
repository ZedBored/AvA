        <h2>The Animator</h2>
        <p>
          The fictional Alan Becker, also known as noogai3 or The Animator is the deuteragonist in the Animator vs.
          Animation series. He is the creator of victim, The Chosen One, The Dark Lord, The Second Coming, and many
          other programs/animations.
        </p>
        <p>
          He served as the overarching antagonist of the first four animations due to constantly fighting against the
          stick figures he creates. This lasts until Animator vs. Animation 4, where he understands that stick figures
          are sentient beings and finally makes peace with them by working a deal out with The Second Coming in exchange
          for teaching him how to draw.
        </p>
      </dialog>
      <dialog id="blackd">
        <h2>The Choosen One</h2>
        <p>
          The Chosen One (tentatively known as victim, killer, and BEAST) is the second stick figure created by Alan
          Becker.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was created five months after his fight with victim, and the first one to prove himself as a genuine threat
          to Alan Becker due to possessing superpowers thanks to his abnormally high power level granted to him by his
          creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          He viciously fought against his creator in Animator vs. Animation 2 but later destroyed and escaped Alan's
          computer with The Dark Lord during the climax of Animator vs. Animation 3.
        </p>
      </dialog>
      <dialog id="oranged">
        <h2>The Second Coming</h2>
        <p>
          The Second Coming, also called Orange, or The Chosen One's Return, is the main protagonist of the Animator vs.
          Animation franchise, along with the Fighting Stick Figures.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is an orange artificial stick figure who was created by Alan Becker in late 2014, three years after The
          Chosen One and The Dark Lord destroyed his old computer. When grouped together alongside the Fighting Stick
          Figures and with him as the leader, the five of them are known as the Stick Gang.
        </p>
      </dialog>
      <dialog id="blued">
        <h2>Blue</h2>
        <p>
          Blue is one of the main protagonists of the Animator vs. Animation franchise, being one of the five members of
          the Stick Gang.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blue is shown to be a pacifist, and is described by Alan as a "hippie," probably due to Blue's love of plants
          and hatred of violence. That said, he is not afraid to fight whenever he or his friends are in trouble.
        </p>
      </dialog>
      <dialog id="greend">
        <h2>Green</h2>
        <p>
          Green is one of the four Fighting Stick Figures. He is the best friend of The Second Coming, a close friend to
          Blue, Yellow and Red.
        </p>
        <p>
          Green is the jack-of-all-trades, capable of doing anything he sets his mind to. Due to this, he can be a
          show-off and a bit arrogant as well, his victory dances after a build battle can rub his friends the wrong
          way. He is probably the most competitive of the Stick Gang.
        </p>
      </dialog>
      <dialog id="yellowd">
        <h2>Yellow</h2>
        <p>
          Yellow is one of the main protagonists of the Animator vs. Animation franchise, being one of the five members
          of the Stick Gang.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yellow is the smartest member of the Stick Gang, and is shown to be the calmest under pressure, able to think
          quickly and accurately in even the most dire of situations. His high intelligence comes in handy, especially
          through his expertise technology.
        </p>
      </dialog>
      <dialog id="redd">
        <h2>Red</h2>
        <p>
          Red is one of the Fighting Stick Figures alongside Yellow, Blue, and Green. He is often nervous and impatient,
          tending to act before thinking, either pressuring his friends to make sure an area is safe or attacking first,
          which usually makes him the first victim to his enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Red is depicted as the youngest, the most aggressive, and the most reckless member of the Stick Gang, known
          for being unafraid to venture into anything, no matter how dangerous it might be. This aggressiveness has led
          himself and his friends to dangerous circumstances
